prooph link
===========

Prooph link is a data linking and workflow processing application. It is build on top of [prooph processing](https://github.com/prooph/processing)
and it is 100% open source. We make use of carefully selected open source libraries from the PHP universe,
add specific logic for process automation and monitoring and put a modern UI on top of it to make
it available for all kind of users no matter if they have development experiences or not.

# Installation

1. Git clone the project in the document root of your webserver. The application is based on a ZF2 Skeleton.
You can follow the instructions of the [ZF2 SkeletonApplication](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication#web-server-setup) to get your web server up and running.

2. The web server needs write access to `config/autolaod` and `data`.

3. Run `php bin/install.php` from the root directory.

4. Navigate to prooph link in your browser of choice. The app detects the fresh installation and suggests the next steps.

# Work In Progress

Prooph link is not stable yet. However, we work hard on getting the job done. So it is just a matter of time.
The application runs already in production, but only with our support. Please contact us if you want to use it, too!
