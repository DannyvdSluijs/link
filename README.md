# About GingerWork

The GingerWork Interface Workflow System is a flexible tool build on top of the [Ginger Workflow Framework](https://github.com/gingerwork/gingerframework).
It has a modern and easy to use UI to manage data-driven processes. With GingerWork IWS you can create automated workflows and connect systems within hours not weeks or months.
It ships with powerful components like data file handling, database integration, support for different communication channels like webservice APIs and service bus connectors and many more.

The system has a plugin architecture, so you can extend it with custom logic required for your individual business.
Ginger IWS takes care of the automated communication between your systems. If something goes wrong, you'll get a message and
have a full log available of every step made in the process.

GingerWork IWS can run on a standard web server with PHP 5.4+ installed. That makes it a good choice for small and mid-sized companies.
But it is also possible to run Ginger IWS in an enterprise environment. It can manage long running processes distributed over systems.
Just connect Ginger IWS to your service bus infrastructure or let it talk with the webservice APIs of your business applications.

# Open Source

The Ginger Workflow Framework and the GingerWork IWS are 100% open source. We make use of carefully selected open source
libraries, add specific logic for process automation and monitoring and put a modern UI on top of it to make
it available for all kind of users no matter if they have development experiences or not.
